## Joomla UI Componens

> A collection of framework agnostic UI components used in the Joomla CMS and released independently.

## What are Custom Elements?
Custom Elements allow you to create custom HTML Tags or extend other people's HTML Tags. For more information on Custom
Elements we strongy recommend you read the Google Documentation [here](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-components/customelements).

## What is the Vision?
These custom elements have been built to allow long term development of core components used on many websites. Our aim
is to allow these to work with many UI frameworks that are commonly used across the internet allowing people to focus on
styling in CSS - whilst we focus here on the more complicated Javascript Elements.

## What Elements are provided?
Please view the components menu items to view information on each component provided here.
